Ubuntu 

Prerequisites 

Make sure that you have the following packages installed. 

 

sudo apt-get update 

sudo apt-get install -y autoconf automake gcc libc6 libmcrypt-dev make libssl-dev wget openssl 
 

  

Downloading the Source  

 

cd /tmp 

wget --no-check-certificate -O nrpe.tar.gz https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nrpe/archive/nrpe-3.2.1.tar.gz 

tar xzf nrpe.tar.gz 
 

  

Compile 

Note that if you want to pass arguments through NRPE you must specify this in the configuration option as indicated below. If you prefer to you can omit the --enable-command-args flag. Removing this flag will require that all arguments be explicitly set in the nrpe.cfg file on each server monitored. 

===== i386 ===== 

 

cd /tmp/nrpe-nrpe-3.2.1/ 

sudo ./configure --enable-command-args --with-ssl-lib=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/ 

sudo make all 
 

  

===== x86_x64 ===== 

 

cd /tmp/nrpe-nrpe-3.2.1/ 

sudo ./configure --enable-command-args --with-ssl-lib=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ 

sudo make all 
 

  

Create User And Group 

This creates the nagios user and group. 

 

sudo make install-groups-users 
 

  

Install Binaries 

This step installs the binary files, the NRPE daemon and the check_nrpe plugin. 

If you only wanted to install the daemon, run the command make install-daemon instead of the command below. However it is useful having the check_nrpe plugin installed for testing purposes. 

If you only wanted to install the check_nrpe plugin, refer to the section at the bottom of this KB article as there a lot of steps that can be skipped. Installing only the plugin is usually done on your Nagios server and workers. 

 

sudo make install 
 

  

Install Configuration Files 

This installs the config files. 

 

sudo make install-config 
 

  

Update Services File 

The /etc/services file is used by applications to translate human readable service names into port numbers when connecting to a machine across a network. 

 

sudo sh -c "echo >> /etc/services" 

sudo sh -c "sudo echo '# Nagios services' >> /etc/services" 

sudo sh -c "sudo echo 'nrpe    5666/tcp' >> /etc/services" 
 

  

Install Service / Daemon 

This installs the service or daemon files. 

===== 13.x / 14.x ===== 

 

sudo make install-init 

  

===== 15.x / 16.x / 17.x ===== 

 

sudo make install-init 

sudo systemctl enable nrpe.service 
 

  

Information on starting and stopping services will be explained further on. 

  

Configure Firewall 

Port 5666 is used by NRPE and needs to be opened on the local firewall. 

 

sudo mkdir -p /etc/ufw/applications.d 

sudo sh -c "echo '[NRPE]' > /etc/ufw/applications.d/nagios" 

sudo sh -c "echo 'title=Nagios Remote Plugin Executor' >> /etc/ufw/applications.d/nagios" 

sudo sh -c "echo 'description=Allows remote execution of Nagios plugins' >> /etc/ufw/applications.d/nagios" 

sudo sh -c "echo 'ports=5666/tcp' >> /etc/ufw/applications.d/nagios" 

sudo ufw allow NRPE 

sudo ufw reload 

  

Update Configuration File 

The file nrpe.cfg is where the following settings will be defined. It is located: 

/usr/local/nagios/etc/nrpe.cfg 

  

allowed_hosts= 

At this point NRPE will only listen to requests from itself (127.0.0.1). If you wanted your nagios server to be able to connect, add it's IP address after a comma (in this example it's 10.25.5.2): 

 

allowed_hosts=127.0.0.1,10.25.5.2 
 

  

dont_blame_nrpe= 

This option determines whether or not the NRPE daemon will allow clients to specify arguments to commands that are executed. We are going to allow this, as it enables more advanced NPRE configurations. 

 

dont_blame_nrpe=1 
 

  

The following commands make the configuration changes described above. 

 

sudo sh -c "sed -i '/^allowed_hosts=/s/$/,10.25.5.2/' /usr/local/nagios/etc/nrpe.cfg" 

sudo sh -c "sed -i 's/^dont_blame_nrpe=.*/dont_blame_nrpe=1/g' /usr/local/nagios/etc/nrpe.cfg" 
 

  

Start Service / Daemon 

Different Linux distributions have different methods of starting NRPE. 

===== 13.x / 14.x ===== 

 

sudo start nrpe 
 

  

===== 15.x / 16.x / 17.x ===== 

 

sudo systemctl start nrpe.service 
 

  

Test NRPE 

Now check that NRPE is listening and responding to requests. 

 

/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_nrpe -H 127.0.0.1 
 

 You should see the output similar to the following: 

 

NRPE v3.2.1 
 

If you get the NRPE version number (as shown above), NRPE is installed and configured correctly. 

You can also test from your Nagios host by executing the same command above, but instead of 127.0.0.1 you will need to replace that with the IP Address / DNS name of the machine with NRPE running. 

  

Service / Daemon Commands 

Different Linux distributions have different methods of starting / stopping / restarting / status NRPE. 



sudo systemctl start nrpe.service 

sudo systemctl stop nrpe.service 

sudo systemctl restart nrpe.service 

sudo systemctl status nrpe.service
